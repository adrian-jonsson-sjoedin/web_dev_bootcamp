                The <b>chicken</b> (<i>Gallus domesticus</i>) is a domesticated <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">junglefowl</a> species, with attributes of wild
                species
                such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or
                cock is
                a
                term
                for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a
                capon.
                An
                adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

                Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
                Asia,[6]
                but
                the
                clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent.
                From
                ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century
                BC.[7]
                Fowl
                have
                been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having
                come
                from
                the
                land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[8][9][10]

            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>
                Galliformes, the order of bird that chickens belong to, is directly linked to the survival of birds when
                all
                other
                dinosaurs went extinct. Water or ground-dwelling fowl, similar to modern partridges, survived the
                Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event that killed all tree-dwelling birds and dinosaurs.[58] Some of
                these
                evolved
                into the modern galliformes, of which domesticated chickens are a main model. They are descended
                primarily
                from
                the
                red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and are scientifically classified as the same species.[59] As such,
                domesticated
                chickens can and do freely interbreed with populations of red junglefowl.[59] Subsequent hybridization
                of
                the
                domestic chicken with grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl and green junglefowl occurred;[60] a gene
                for
                yellow
                skin, for instance, was incorporated into domestic birds through hybridization with the grey junglefowl
                (G.
                sonneratii).[61] In a study published in 2020, it was found that chickens shared between 71% - 79% of
                their
                genome
                with red junglefowl, with the period of domestication dated to 8,000 years ago.[60]

            <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
            <p>
                Chickens are omnivores.[28] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects,
                and
                even
                animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[29] or sometimes young mice.
