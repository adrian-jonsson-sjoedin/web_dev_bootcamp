        The <b>chicken</b> (<i>Gallus domesticus</i>) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild
        species
        such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a
        term
        for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon.
        An
        adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[6] but
        the
        clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From
        ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[7] Fowl
        have
        been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from
        the
        land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[8][9][10]

    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>
        Galliformes, the order of bird that chickens belong to, is directly linked to the survival of birds when all
        other
        dinosaurs went extinct. Water or ground-dwelling fowl, similar to modern partridges, survived the
        Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event that killed all tree-dwelling birds and dinosaurs.[58] Some of these
        evolved
        into the modern galliformes, of which domesticated chickens are a main model. They are descended primarily from
        the
        red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and are scientifically classified as the same species.[59] As such, domesticated
        chickens can and do freely interbreed with populations of red junglefowl.[59] Subsequent hybridization of the
        domestic chicken with grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl and green junglefowl occurred;[60] a gene for
        yellow
        skin, for instance, was incorporated into domestic birds through hybridization with the grey junglefowl (G.
        sonneratii).[61] In a study published in 2020, it was found that chickens shared between 71% - 79% of their
        genome
        with red junglefowl, with the period of domestication dated to 8,000 years ago.[60]

    <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
    <p>
        Chickens are omnivores.[28] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and even
        animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[29] or sometimes young mice.
